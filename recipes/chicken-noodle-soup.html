    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There's nothing more comforting when you're feeling under the weather than a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup.  This easy recipe is deeply flavorful with a savory base of store-bought ingredients</p>
    <p>Though typically recipes will utilize egg-noodles, for our version we prefer spaghetti cut into bite size pieces.  The final product gives a nostalgic nod to canned versions with loads more flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>8 Cups Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>1 Chopped Onion</li>
        <li>1 Chopped Carrot</li>
        <li>1 Celery Rib</li>
        <li>5 Ounces Spaghetti Cut</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in dutch oven over medium-high heat until simmering.  Cook chicken until well browned all over, 8-10 min.</li>
        <li>Add broth, onion, carrot, celery scraping up any browned bits.  Bring to boil, cover, and reduce heat to low.  Simmer until breasts register 160 degrees. 14-17 min.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat.  Transfer chicken to plate and shred using two forks.</li>
        <li>Return soup to boil over medium-high heat and add pasta.  Cook uncovered until pasta is tender, 9-11 min, stirring often.  Add chicken until chicken is warmed through.  Season with salt and pepper and serve.</li>

    </ul>
